##Tempto Nova
A new codebase to start development of Tempto from

First operations;
 - Rendering System
 - World System (i.e. loading segments of a map)
 - Map Editing (At first with tiled, and then build a standalone program to make the process as smooth as possible)
 - Physics System (Kinda start alongside map editing, just to have the terrain to build off of)
 - Entity System
 - Player
 - NPCs
